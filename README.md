# Tauri 2

This repository contains adapters and documentation around using [Tauri](https://tauri.app) v2 with specta-rs projects ([rspc](http://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc), [specta](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/specta) & [tauri-specta](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/tauri-specta)).

This repository will be archived and it's changes upstreamed once Tauri v2 is released as stable in the coming months.

This is primarily targetted at early adopters.

## rspc

|            | Tauri v1                                                          | Tauri v2                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| rspc 0.1.x | Use the 'tauri' feature on `rspc`                                 | Unsupported. [Upgrade to rspc 0.2.x](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc/releases/tag/v0.2.0) |
| rspc 0.2.x | [Use `rspc_tauri` crate](https://www.rspc.dev/integrations/tauri) | Use [`rspc_tauri2`](./rspc_tauri2)                                                               |

### Using `rspc_tauri2`

To import it add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
rspc-tauri2 = { git = "https://github.com/specta-rs/tauri2", rev = "1a41c9217ccec1814e3e4c5e343bcc9739efab40" }
```

Then [follow the rspc docs](https://www.rspc.dev/integrations/tauri) but replace `rspc_tauri` with `rspc_tauri2`.

You will also need to use [`@rspc/tauri`](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/tauri-specta/blob/main/docs/v2.md) import from [here](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc/tree/v0.x/packages/tauri2) which is not published to npm.

I would highly recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) and copying the patch from [rspc_example/patches/@rspc__tauri@0.2.0.patch](https://github.com/specta-rs/tauri2/blob/main/rspc_example/patches/%40rspc__tauri%400.2.0.patch) and then copying the `patches` section from the [package.json](https://github.com/specta-rs/tauri2/blob/0db5c136c68ca4ae13734a43c1980ca9cd81ab11/rspc_example/package.json#L23).

## Tauri Specta

You can follow the documentation [here](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/tauri-specta/blob/main/docs/v2.md) for Tauri v2 support.

## Specta

|         | tauri1                          | tauri2                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| specta1 | Via 'tauri' feature on `specta` | Unsupported. Upgrade to specta2  |
| specta2 | Unsupported. Upgrade to Tauri2  | Via 'specta' feature on  `tauri` |

Previously Specta had a `tauri` feature on `specta` for functions support. This function support is what powers Tauri Specta.

## FAQ?

### Why a whole repository for this?

You can't actually have Tauri and Tauri v2 in the same Cargo workspace.

This is due to Tauri depending on C/C++ libraries such as Webkit which link against shared libraries. Cargo flags the potential for the same shared library to be linked twice and bails out.

This would make sense at a crate level but the resolver isn't super smart and bails out at a workspace level.

You will see an error like the following if you hit this:
```
error: failed to select a version for `webkit2gtk-sys`.
    ... required by package `webkit2gtk v2.0.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `webkit2gtk = "=2.0.1"` of package `tauri v2.0.0-beta.13`
    ... which satisfies dependency `tauri = "=2.0.0-beta.13"` of package `rspc-tauri2 v0.0.1 (/Users/oscar/Desktop/rspc-014/crates/tauri2)`
versions that meet the requirements `^2.0.1` are: 2.0.1

the package `webkit2gtk-sys` links to the native library `web_kit2`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `web_kit2` as well:
package `webkit2gtk-sys v0.18.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `ffi = "^0.18"` of package `webkit2gtk v0.18.2`
    ... which satisfies dependency `webkit2gtk = "^0.18.2"` of package `tauri v1.6.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `tauri = "=1.6.1"` of package `rspc-tauri v0.0.1 (/Users/oscar/Desktop/rspc-014/crates/tauri)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "web_kit2"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.
